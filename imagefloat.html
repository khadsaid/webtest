            Coffee is a brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found inside "berries" of the coffea plants. The seeds are then roasted,a process which transforms them into a consumable product:The roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.The degree of roast has an effect upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are generally bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts are more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor due to presence of more aromatic oils. The actual roasting of beans starts at 200 °C (392 °F) temperaturethough different varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density may roast at different rates.During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.
